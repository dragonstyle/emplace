## Example

The following document provides a simple example of embedding a Mastodon post. Currently the only supported arguments are the URL to the post to be shared.

{{< share-post https://sciencemastodon.com/@gdyson/111371030805595929 >}}

In addition to Mastodon, the short will render posts for Twitter, Threads, Instragram, and Pinterest.
